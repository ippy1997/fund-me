# FundMe smart contract

This project demonstrates a basic crowd funding smart contract use case. It comes with a FundMe contract and a priceConverter Library, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
